# Portfolio Template

## First-time setup

##### Getting your own copy of the template

* Click the **Fork** icon in the top-right corner.

##### Updating your username

* Click the **Settings** tab, then change the **Repository name** to `yourGithubUsername.github.io`. For example, a student with the Github username of _johnd1234_ would change their **Repository name** to `johnd1234.github.io`

In the future, you will be editing these files using an IDE. For now, you will be editing these files directly on github.com


* Click `script.js`, then click the pencil icon to edit the file.
* Change `ownerName` to your name: it can be your first name, first and last name, for first name / last initial. For example, _John_ or _John Doe_ or _John D._ This will be what displays in your navigation bar and tab title of the browser.
* Change `userName` to your Github username. It must match _exactly_. For example, _johnd1234_.
* Click the green **commit** button at the bottom.

##### Uploading your logo

_NOTE: It is recommended you rename your logo file to_`logo.png`

* Click on `yourUsername.github.io` towards the top to get back to the directory of all of the files.
* Click on the folder `img`.
* Click on **Upload files** and upload your logo. Click the green **commit** button at the bottom.
* Click on `yourUsername.github.io` towards the top to get back to the directory of all of the files.
* Click `index.html`, then click the pencil icon to edit the file.
* Around line 45, you'll see `<img src="img/avatar.png"...`. Change `img/avatar.png` to `img/logo.png` (unless you have a different filename).
* Stay on `index.html` for now.

##### Updating your information

* Still on `index.html`, around line 100, you'll see `Lorem ipsum...`. Feel free to change that text to whatever you want!
