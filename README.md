* Click the **Fork** icon in the top-right corner.
* Click the **Settings** tab, then change the **Repository name** to `yourGithubUsername.github.io`. For example, a student with the Github username of _johnd1234_ would change their **Repository name** to `johnd1234.github.io`

In the future, you will be editing these files using an IDE. For now, you will be editing these files directly on github.com

* Click `script.js`, then click the pencil icon to edit the file.
  * Change `ownerName` to your name: it can be your first name, first and last name, for first name / last initial. For example, **John** or **John Doe** or **John D.**. This will be what displays in your navigation bar and tab title of the browser.
  * Change `userName` to your Github username. It must match _exactly_. For example, _johnd1234_.
  * Click the green **commit** button at the bottom.

* Click on `yourUsername.github.io` towards the top to get back to the directory of all of the files.
* Click on **Upload files** and upload your logo.
